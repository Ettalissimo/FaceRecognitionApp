# FaceRecognitionApp
Building access control system using facial recognition / Système de contrôle d’accès à un bâtiment à l’aide de la reconnaissance faciale 

Abstract:
This report represents our end-of-year project. The purpose of this work was to deepen and put into practice our knowledge of software development. This project also allowed us to discover the world of computer vision and face recognition. During the making of this project, we also had to learn to program graphical interfaces to make it easier for the user to manipulate the
system. In addition, we made a client-server system to allow the transmission of data between two computers.
To do this, the first thing we had to do was to understand the problem, the needs and the objectives to be attained. Secondly, we studied the architecture of the system and its different
components. Then, we studied the functioning of a face recognition algorithm.
Afterward, we got into the realization of the app. During this phase, we started by programming the face recognition algorithm. When it was fully operational, we focused on creating
the graphical user interfaces. Finally, we wrote the code to provide a client-server connection between two computers. After the end of each of the development stages, we did tests to ensure
the proper functioning of the different implemented functionalities and, also, to guarantee the smooth running of the project.
This project was made in Python in addition to some of its frameworks. Moreover, Pickle
files served as databases for this app.
